Men get harsher prison sentences than women because again women should be home with the kids and women are seen as weaker. Men take on riskier jobs because women are seen as too dainty to handle it. Men aren't allowed to cry because women are the emotional ones. Men can't be raped because they're the ""stronger"" sex so should be able to fight off the ""weaker"" sex plus they're supposed to always want sex (toxic masculinity). It just seems to me that any perceived sexism towards men comes directly from the ideas that persist in our society because of sexism towards women.",can you give me an example of sexism against men that is nt a direct result of sexist idea against woman men lose custody battle because raising child is seen a the woman s job men get harsher prison sentence than woman because again woman should be home with the kid and woman are seen a weaker men take on riskier job because woman are seen a too dainty to handle it men are nt allowed to cry because woman are the emotional one men ca nt be raped because they re the stronger sex so should be able to fight off the weaker sex plus they re supposed to always want sex toxic masculinity it just seems to me that any perceived sexism towards men come directly from the idea that persist in our society because of sexism towards woman,0.25

If the girl was passed out, and the guy was stone cold sober, he could easily get away with saying she consented and is just regretting it after the fact. It's fucked up. I'm single, and kinda scared to meet women at bars for this reason.
