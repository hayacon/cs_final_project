Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. 

For those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.

By that rationale, we should also outlaw bars and alcohol because they also facilitate extra-marital sex.  How about also setting a curfew and a bed-time for everyone in America and getting rid of all the filth in music and on television?

It is not the business of the governments to try to outlaw things that don't facilitate marriage.  American adults get to choose what kind of sex life they wish to have with other wiling adults.  No one wants a church-government. 

>Prostitution is correlated with drug use and psychological problems.

As for God, your own definition is: ""I define God as the greatest conceivable being.""

The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

These qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception.

So, the question is: ""does the Greatest Conceivable Being exists?"" and the answer is obviously: no, because that question is nonsensical.

TLDR: You can't claim god's existence unless the definition of god is finite and non-paradoxical.

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

Sociological forces are at play, is my point. Also, the burden of children is something you shouldn't neglect. There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings.
