  Developing the ML Model With Genetic Algorithm \\
  \large BSc Computer Science Final Project
}
Karl Sims first propose the genetic algorithm with evolving virtual creatures.
Since then, there have been many genetic algorithm applications, and developing a machine learning model is one of them.
In this project, I attempt to develop a machine learning model to predict the offensiveness of English comments using the genetic algorithm.
